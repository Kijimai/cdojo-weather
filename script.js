//TO DO
// When to user clicks on a city, display an alert
// Clicking "I accept" will dismiss the cookie policy message
// - Make an "active" class to slowly animate it into being, then remove it on a setTimeout by taking the class off.
// Convert the temperatures when the <select> element is changed
